1. Identifying a Function with an "S" Shaped Graph
1.1 "S" Shaped Graph

When you come across a graph with an S shape, here’s how you can determine if it’s a function of x:

One x-value corresponds to only one y-value:
This means that for each input 
𝑥
x, there should be only one corresponding output 
𝑦
y.

Vertical Line Test:
The vertical line test helps you figure out if the graph represents a function. If you can draw a vertical line that intersects the graph at only one point, then the graph is a function. However, if the vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, it’s not a function.

Visual Example:


1.2 Domain and Range

Domain: The set of all possible x-values that can be plugged into the function. It defines the valid input values for the function.

Range: The set of all possible y-values that the function can output. It represents the output values of the function.

2. Difference Quotient

The difference quotient measures the rate of change of a function between two points. The formula looks like this:

𝑓
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
)
−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
ℎ
h
f(x+h)−f(x)
	​


Here:

𝑓
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
)
−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x+h)−f(x) represents the change in function values.

ℎ
h represents the change in x-values.

In simpler terms, it gives the slope of the secant line that connects the points 
(
𝑥
,
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
(x,f(x)) and 
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
,
𝑓
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
)
)
(x+h,f(x+h)).

2.1 How the Difference Quotient Connects to Derivatives

If you take the limit of the difference quotient as 
ℎ
h approaches 0, you get the derivative of the function. The derivative shows the instantaneous rate of change of the function, and we write it like this:

𝑓
′
(
𝑥
)
=
lim
⁡
ℎ
→
0
𝑓
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
)
−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
ℎ
f
′
(x)=
h→0
lim
	​

h
f(x+h)−f(x)
	​


So the difference quotient is essentially the definition of the derivative.

3. Domain Restrictions for Different Functions
3.1 How to Find the Domain for Different Types of Functions

Rational Functions:
The denominator cannot equal 0. For instance, the function 
1
𝑥
x
1
	​

 is undefined when 
𝑥
=
0
x=0.

Square Root Functions:
The expression inside the square root cannot be negative (for even roots).
For example, 
𝑥
−
3
x−3
	​

 is only defined when 
𝑥
≥
3
x≥3.

Odd roots (like cube roots) do not have this restriction; they can work with all real numbers.

Logarithmic Functions:
The argument of the logarithm must be positive.
For example, 
log
⁡
(
𝑥
−
1
)
log(x−1) is defined only when 
𝑥
>
1
x>1.

4. Understanding the Range

The range refers to the set of output values 
𝑦
y.
For example, let’s consider the function 
4
−
𝑥
2
4−x
2
. If you plug in 
𝑥
=
0
x=0, you get the output 2. Here, 0 is the minimum value, and 2 is the maximum value for this function.

5. Solving Stewart's Calculus 9th Edition: Problem 30 from Section 1.1
5.1 Deriving the Slope Formula

I ran into some trouble with Problem 30 at first because I hadn’t properly worked out the slope formula. The slope between two points measures the rate of change, and it’s given by:

𝑚
=
𝑦
2
−
𝑦
1
𝑥
2
−
𝑥
1
m=
x
2
	​

−x
1
	​

y
2
	​

−y
1
	​

	​


This formula calculates the slope of the line between points 
(
𝑥
1
,
𝑦
1
)
(x
1
	​

,y
1
	​

) and 
(
𝑥
2
,
𝑦
2
)
(x
2
	​

,y
2
	​

).

6. Graphing Functions Based on Their Equations

I also learned how to find out which points a graph will pass through just by looking at the function's equation. For example, if we’re given:

0
≤
𝑥
≤
3
0≤x≤3

Substitute 
𝑥
=
0
x=0 into the equation, and you get the point (0, 3). Similarly, substituting 
𝑥
=
3
x=3 gives the point (3, 0). It was a cool realization that by plugging in different x-values, you can figure out some of the key points of the graph.

7. Final Thoughts ✨

This was a really insightful learning experience. Even though Calculus 1 can be a tough subject, the sense of discovery and the satisfaction of solving problems make it really rewarding. It also felt like I finally had time to dive deep into math, especially after having so little of that time during my time in the military.

Looking forward, as I aim to become an AI engineer, I know that this experience of problem-solving and learning will help me stay focused and passionate. Keep following my journey, as I keep pushing myself toward my goals!
