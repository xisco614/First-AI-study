🧠 Cognitive Science and Computer Science Integration

As an aspiring AI Engineer with a strong focus on Cognitive Science, I believe that understanding how the human brain processes information is key to building intelligent systems that interact more naturally with humans. The synergy between Cognitive Science and AI will allow me to create AI systems that are not just technically robust but also human-centered and cognitively intuitive.

Cognitive Science Areas I'm Exploring:

Neural Networks & Brain Simulation: How artificial neural networks simulate the structure and function of the human brain.

Human Perception and Interaction: Investigating how people perceive information and interact with technology to create more intuitive and adaptive interfaces.

Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making: Understanding how cognitive biases impact human behavior, and how to design AI systems that mitigate these biases.

Attention and Memory: Exploring how attention mechanisms and memory models in humans can be applied to AI models for better decision-making and problem-solving.

How Cognitive Science Helps in AI:

By studying cognitive processes, I aim to create more efficient algorithms that are informed by human perception, decision-making, and memory systems. This interdisciplinary approach will contribute to the creation of human-centric AI that is more adaptable, intuitive, and empathetic.
